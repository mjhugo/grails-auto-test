## Grails support

Version 1.0 of this plugin works with Grails 2.0 or higher. If you have a Grails application using a version of grails prior to 2.0, please use version 0.1 of this plugin

## Usage

```
$ grails
| Enter a script name to run. Use TAB for completion: 
grails> auto-test
```

The plugin will monitor the project directory and will attempt to run only the subset of tests affected by what changed.  This is very rudimentary - for example, if you modify BookController or BookControllerTests or BookControllerSpec, it will run `test-app BookController`

In order to run functional tests continually upon changes, the application must be started separately and the "-baseUrl" command line arg must be used to run against already started instance. Here is an example:

```
$ grails
| Enter a script name to run. Use TAB for completion: 
grails> run-app
| Server running. Browse to http://localhost:8080/app
grails> auto-test -baseUrl=http://localhost:8080/app/
```
